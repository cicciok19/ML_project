    Build a Keras model with SSD architecture, see references.

    The model consists of convolutional feature layers and a number of convolutional
    predictor layers that take their input from different feature layers.
    The model is fully convolutional.

    The implementation found here is a smaller version of the original architecture
    used in the paper (where the base network consists of a modified VGG-16 extended
    by a few convolutional feature layers), but of course it could easily be changed to
    an arbitrarily large SSD architecture by following the general design pattern used here.
    This implementation has 7 convolutional layers and 4 convolutional predictor
    layers that take their input from layers 4, 5, 6, and 7, respectively.

    In case you're wondering why this function has so many arguments: All arguments except
    the first two (`image_size` and `n_classes`) are only needed so that the anchor box
    layers can produce the correct anchor boxes. In case you're training the network, the
    parameters passed here must be the same as the ones used to set up `SSDBoxEncoder`.
    In case you're loading trained weights, the parameters passed here must be the same
    as the ones used to produce the trained weights.

    Some of these arguments are explained in more detail in the documentation of the
    `SSDBoxEncoder` class.

    Note: Requires Keras v2.0 or later. Training currently works only with the
    TensorFlow backend (v1.0 or later).

    Arguments:
        image_size (tuple): The input image size in the format `(height, width, channels)`.
        n_classes (int): The number of positive classes, e.g. 20 for Pascal VOC, 80 for MS COCO.
        l2_regularization (float, optional): The L2-regularization rate. Applies to all convolutional layers.
        min_scale (float, optional): The smallest scaling factor for the size of the anchor boxes as a fraction
            of the shorter side of the input images.
        max_scale (float, optional): The largest scaling factor for the size of the anchor boxes as a fraction
            of the shorter side of the input images. All scaling factors between the smallest and the
            largest will be linearly interpolated. Note that the second to last of the linearly interpolated
            scaling factors will actually be the scaling factor for the last predictor layer, while the last
            scaling factor is used for the second box for aspect ratio 1 in the last predictor layer
            if `two_boxes_for_ar1` is `True`.
        scales (list, optional): A list of floats containing scaling factors per convolutional predictor layer.
            This list must be one element longer than the number of predictor layers. The first `k` elements are the
            scaling factors for the `k` predictor layers, while the last element is used for the second box
            for aspect ratio 1 in the last predictor layer if `two_boxes_for_ar1` is `True`. This additional
            last scaling factor must be passed either way, even if it is not being used.
            Defaults to `None`. If a list is passed, this argument overrides `min_scale` and
            `max_scale`. All scaling factors must be greater than zero.
        aspect_ratios_global (list, optional): The list of aspect ratios for which anchor boxes are to be
            generated. This list is valid for all predictor layers. The original implementation uses more aspect ratios
            for some predictor layers and fewer for others. If you want to do that, too, then use the next argument instead.
            Defaults to `[0.5, 1.0, 2.0]`.
        aspect_ratios_per_layer (list, optional): A list containing one aspect ratio list for each predictor layer.
            This allows you to set the aspect ratios for each predictor layer individually. If a list is passed,
            it overrides `aspect_ratios_global`.
        two_boxes_for_ar1 (bool, optional): Only relevant for aspect ratio lists that contain 1. Will be ignored otherwise.
            If `True`, two anchor boxes will be generated for aspect ratio 1. The first will be generated
            using the scaling factor for the respective layer, the second one will be generated using
            geometric mean of said scaling factor and next bigger scaling factor. Defaults to `True`, following the original
            implementation.
        steps (list, optional): `None` or a list with as many elements as there are predictor layers. The elements can be
            either ints/floats or tuples of two ints/floats. These numbers represent for each predictor layer how many
            pixels apart the anchor box center points should be vertically and horizontally along the spatial grid over
            the image. If the list contains ints/floats, then that value will be used for both spatial dimensions.
            If the list contains tuples of two ints/floats, then they represent `(step_height, step_width)`.
            If no steps are provided, then they will be computed such that the anchor box center points will form an
            equidistant grid within the image dimensions.
        offsets (list, optional): `None` or a list with as many elements as there are predictor layers. The elements can be
            either floats or tuples of two floats. These numbers represent for each predictor layer how many
            pixels from the top and left boarders of the image the top-most and left-most anchor box center points should be
            as a fraction of `steps`. The last bit is important: The offsets are not absolute pixel values, but fractions
            of the step size specified in the `steps` argument. If the list contains floats, then that value will
            be used for both spatial dimensions. If the list contains tuples of two floats, then they represent
            `(vertical_offset, horizontal_offset)`. If no offsets are provided, then they will default to 0.5 of the step size,
            which is also the recommended setting.
        limit_boxes (bool, optional): If `True`, limits box coordinates to stay within image boundaries.
            This would normally be set to `True`, but here it defaults to `False`, following the original
            implementation.
        variances (list, optional): A list of 4 floats >0 with scaling factors (actually it's not factors but divisors
            to be precise) for the encoded predicted box coordinates. A variance value of 1.0 would apply
            no scaling at all to the predictions, while values in (0,1) upscale the encoded predictions and values greater
            than 1.0 downscale the encoded predictions. If you want to reproduce the configuration of the original SSD,
            set this to `[0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.2]`, provided the coordinate format is 'centroids'.
        coords (str, optional): The box coordinate format to be used. Can be either 'centroids' for the format
            `(cx, cy, w, h)` (box center coordinates, width, and height) or 'minmax' for the format
            `(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)`.
        normalize_coords (bool, optional): Set to `True` if the model is supposed to use relative instead of absolute coordinates,
            i.e. if the model predicts box coordinates within [0,1] instead of absolute coordinates.
        subtract_mean (array-like, optional): `None` or an array-like object of integers or floating point values
            of any shape that is broadcast-compatible with the image shape. The elements of this array will be
            subtracted from the image pixel intensity values. For example, pass a list of three integers
            to perform per-channel mean normalization for color images.
        divide_by_stddev (array-like, optional): `None` or an array-like object of non-zero integers or
            floating point values of any shape that is broadcast-compatible with the image shape. The image pixel
            intensity values will be divided by the elements of this array. For example, pass a list
            of three integers to perform per-channel standard deviation normalization for color images.
        swap_channels (bool, optional): If `True`, the color channel order of the input images will be reversed,
            i.e. if the input color channel order is RGB, the color channels will be swapped to BGR.
        return_predictor_sizes (bool, optional): If `True`, this function not only returns the model, but also
            a list containing the spatial dimensions of the predictor layers. This isn't strictly necessary since
            you can always get their sizes easily via the Keras API, but it's convenient and less error-prone
            to get them this way. They are only relevant for training anyway (SSDBoxEncoder needs to know the
            spatial dimensions of the predictor layers), for inference you don't need them.

    Returns:
        model: The Keras SSD model.
        predictor_sizes (optional): A Numpy array containing the `(height, width)` portion
            of the output tensor shape for each convolutional predictor layer. During
            training, the generator function needs this in order to transform
            the ground truth labels into tensors of identical structure as the
            output tensors of the model, which is in turn needed for the cost
            function.
